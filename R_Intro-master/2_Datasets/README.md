# Datasets
This activity introduces you to working with and visualizing data in R. The script will go through some basic concepts that are commonly used in ecology datasets.The script introduces you to working with time and date data, and my favorite way of working with dates: the day of year. You will learn a couple ways to aggregate data based on an identifier. _ifelse_ and _if_ statements can be very useful in sorting or identifying your data if you have a condition that you want to sort by. You will also be introduced to setting up data flags, which are a useful way to include quality control in your code and check for typos or discrepencies in data.  

### Objectives

1. using packages
2. working with time/date data
3. aggregate type functions
4. _ifelse_ and _if_ statements
5. setting up data flags
6. plotting data
 

#### Files
1. _R_intro2_code.r_
2. _thaw_depth.csv_


##### _thaw_depth.csv_ contains data collected on the active layer thickness (the depth between the ground surface and permafrost in cm) in northeastern Sibera. The data was collected from a high denisty larch forest (Davydov) and a low density forest (LDF2). The measurements were initially collected on transects established from an ecosystem inventory in the initial sampling period, but were collected below trees with sap flow sensors in the remaining sampling period.
